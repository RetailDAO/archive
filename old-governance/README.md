# Old Governance Documents

This subfolder in the [archive](https://github.com/RetailDAO/archive) repository stores deprecated governance documents from RetailDAO’s early days. 

## Purpose
The `old-governance` subfolder preserves historical governance documents, such as early constitutions and proposals, for transparency and community review. These documents are no longer active but are kept for auditability.

## Key Documents
### Retail DAO Genesis Proposal
The Genesis Proposal outlines the initial setup of RetailDAO, including the $RETAIL token and Original Mint Authorized DAO.

- **Status**: Superseded by current governance in the [governance](https://github.com/RetailDAO/governance) repository.

## Transparency
RetailDAO is committed to transparency:
- Historical governance documents are preserved here for community review.
- The $RETAIL token’s minting permissions are going to be revoked to cap supply at 1 billion tokens, documented in [smart-contracts/original-dao](https://github.com/RetailDAO/smart-contracts/tree/main/original-dao).
- Current governance processes are in the [governance](https://github.com/RetailDAO/governance) repository, with details in [documentation](https://github.com/RetailDAO/documentation).
